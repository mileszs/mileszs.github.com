# Miles’s Gift Guidance

“Miles, you’re hard to buy gifts for.”

“WHAT!? But I have so many hobbies\! I want _so many_ things!”

“Well, yeah, but you also buy yourself most of the things you want, and have specific preferences.”

“Oh, well, that’s true.”

Hopefully this will help.

_FYI: I put some _expensive_ items on here. I don't expect them as gifts. I don't expect any gifts! Hell, just get me a bottle of dry red wine. It will definitely get used. No, I put the expensive stuff on there in case you come across a used one or a great deal (or both). I hope you'll be inspired to tell me about it! :-)_

## Clothes

Your best bet here is probably to avoid getting me clothes, to be honest. I’m persnickety, as Grandma would say. I’ll try to give some guidance, though.

* I don’t prefer to wear black, typically. I will, but I’d prefer earth tones typically.
* I wear “large” in shirts, typically.
* I prefer an athletic fit shirt, or I might not wear it. I *do not* like baggy, and I typically don’t like shirts that are boxy even. I do not like wide or kinda-long t-shirt sleeves.
* In pants, I typically wear 36x32. I do not like baggy pants. In athletic wear pants or shorts, probably “large”.
* I like running shorts with zipper pockets\! Been thinking about getting some Chicken Leg shorts because they’re amusing, but not sure anyone wants to see all of these thighs
* I’m good on jackets, honestly. I have so many. Exceptions are perhaps great deals on name-brand outdoor company rain jackets for hiking.

### Shoes

I’m probably pretty good on shoes at this time. That said:

* I wear 11.5, typically
* I like a wide toebox, which are becoming a bit more common
* Sperrys or Hey Dudes or that sort of slip on casual shoe are welcomed (my old Toms are looking ratty!)
* I want Chacos (Classics or Z/Cloud), but they’re so expensive; I’ve looked at used ones, actually

## Musical Instruments

I am more than happy to get *used* instruments. In fact, a part of me prefers it because it saves money and feels a little like recycling. Instruments can be expensive. I will put some expensive instruments on here, but I don’t expect anyone to actually buy those for me. However, if you come across a great deal on one of them, I’d love you to let me know.

* Vibraslap
* Tambourine (hand)
* Tambourine (foot—it’s a thing!)
* Various other hand percussion instruments (cabasa, guiro, etc)
* Hi-hat (to go with the snare drum I have)
* Tenor or Baritone Ukulele
* Drum set (acoustic)
* Fender (or Squier) Stratocaster
* 5-string bass guitar

### Accessories

* Guitar or bass effects pedals; I love ‘fuzz’ pedals, but anything is fun!
* Ukulele strap
* Saxophone strap; I have one, but I bet there are interesting fancy ones out there?

### Miscellaneous but Related

* PA System (I could theoretically host jam sessions like a full band!)

## Books

It's genuinely difficult to buy *new* books for me. No doubt about it. I buy a lot of books for myself, and I am a mood reader—it’s hard to predict what I am reading or will read. However, I do collect\!

Again, I’m happy to get used books.

* Hard cover or collector’s editions of J.R.R. Tolkien’s books, particularly the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit
* Hard cover or collector’s editions of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. books
* Dungeon Crawler Carl series by Matt Dinniman; I don’t own any of these, but have read them all
* A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin; I don’t own any of these, but have read them all
* Dan Da Dan (manga)
* Dorhedoro (manga)

## Camping, Backpacking, & Hiking

This one is really hard, because particularly with backpacking I have very specific preferences. Also, as a family, we’ve struggled to go camping as often as I’d like.

* Multi-tool with pliers; light ones for backpacking, but any would be good in general; I’d probably carry it in my daily backpack, actually
* Camp cots; I have one, but I think the whole family would be more comfortable if we had one for each of us
* Camp kitchen table; this would be the type of thing that holds my Coleman camp stove, plus has a prep area, possibly storage underneath, etc; and folds up for travel
* Retractable clothes line; I could probably make one, but I’ve been saying that in my head for years
* Portable camp toilet
* Pop up shelter for the camp toilet

## Exercise, Gym, etc

* Weighted vest at 40lbs or more
* Adjustable weight dumbbells
* Squat rack with pull-up bar

## Tools

Used tools are good, too! I don’t mind.

I’m not _super_ handy, but I do stuff here and there. Maybe even more than that, I like to _try_ to do stuff. Haha.

* Impact driver
* Belt sander (hand)
* Belt & disc sander (standing)
* Toolbox—portable for taking tools to the school for the musical; relatively large so I can just throw stuff from my primary toolbox into it and go. Maybe even wheeled?
* Lathe (Seems so fun, but this is probably ridiculous of me)


## Disc Golf

I really enjoy disc golf. It’s like a hike while throwing a frisbee.

* Backpack; I have a shoulder sling style disc bag, but I’d like a full backpack that would fit 20 discs and my extendable disc grabber. There are some affordable ones on Amazon, like the Apex one that is green and brown. I don’t need one of the super duper expensive ones, considering I don’t actually play that often. Yet.
* Disc golf discs with cool prints. Used is fine\! I am not good enough to have strong disc preferences.
* Any silly, fun, weird accessories

## Indoor Climbing

This is probably my favorite activity, but I'm not paying for a membership right this second. It's expensive! I'll get back to it, though.

* A month of membership? Haha
* A chalk bag with waist belt; they make some really nifty designs :-)

## Plants

I love indoor plants, particularly easy ones. Haha.

* Pothos; you can never have enough pothos
* Pots; any neat plant pot is welcomed! Even plain terracotta is great to have on hand, but crazy fantasy-themed stuff is exciting
* Plants + technology is fascinating to me; I'd love to collect data on my soil moisture levels, etc

## Miscellaneous

* The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy on Blu-Ray — extended edition!
* DVDs of live concerts for bands I like
