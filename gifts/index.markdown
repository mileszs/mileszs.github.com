# Miles’s Gift Guidance

“Miles, you’re hard to buy gifts for.”

“WHAT!? But I have so many hobbies\! I want _so many_ things!”

“Well, yeah, but you also buy yourself most of the things you want, and have specific preferences.”

“Oh, well, that’s true.”

Hopefully this will help.

# Musical Instruments

I am more than happy to get *used* instruments. In fact, a part of me prefers it because it saves money and feels a little like recycling. Instruments can be expensive. I will put some expensive instruments on here, but I don’t expect anyone to actually buy those for me. However, if you come across a great deal on one of them, I’d love you to let me know.

* Vibraslap  
* Tambourine (hand)  
* Tambourine (foot—it’s a thing!)  
* Various other hand percussion instruments (cabasa, guiro, etc)  
* Hi-hat (to go with the snare drum I have)  
* Tenor or Baritone Ukulele  
* Drum set (acoustic)  
* Fender (or Squier) Stratocaster  
* 5-string bass guitar

## Accessories

* Guitar or bass effects pedals; I love ‘fuzz’ pedals, but anything is fun!  
* Ukulele strap  
* Saxophone strap; I have one, but I bet there are interesting fancy ones out there?

## Miscellaneous but Related

* PA System (I could theoretically host jam sessions like a full band!)

# Books

It's genuinely difficult to buy *new* books for me. No doubt about it. I buy a lot of books for myself, and I am a mood reader—it’s hard to predict what I am reading or will read. However, I do collect\! 

Again, I’m happy to get used books.

* Hard cover or collector’s editions of J.R.R. Tolkien’s books, particularly the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit  
* Hard cover or collector’s editions of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. books  
* Dungeon Crawler Carl series by Matt Dinniman; I don’t own any of these, but have read them all  
* A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin; I don’t own any of these, but have read them all  
* Dan Da Dan (manga)  
* Dorhedoro (manga)

# Tools

Used tools are good, too\! I don’t mind. 

I’m not *super* handy, but I do stuff here and there. Maybe even more than that, I like to try to do stuff. Haha.

* Impact Driver  
* Belt sander (hand)  
* Belt & disc sander (standing)  
* Toolbox for taking tools to the school for the musical; relatively large so I can just throw stuff from my primary toolbox into it and go. Maybe even wheeled?

# Clothes

Your best bet here is probably to avoid getting me clothes, to be honest. I’m persnickety, as Grandma would say. I’ll try to give some guidance, though. 

* I don’t prefer to wear black, typically. I will, but I’d prefer earth tones typically.  
* I wear “large” in shirts, typically.   
* I prefer an athletic fit shirt, or I might not wear it. I *do not* like baggy, and I typically don’t like shirts that are boxy even. I do not like wide or kinda-long t-shirt sleeves.  
* In pants, I typically wear 36x32. I do not like baggy pants. In athletic wear pants or shorts, probably “large”.  
* I like running shorts with zipper pockets\! Been thinking about getting some Chicken Leg shorts because they’re amusing, but not sure anyone wants to see all of these thighs  
* I’m good on jackets, honestly. I have so many. Exceptions are perhaps great deals on name-brand outdoor company rain jackets for hiking.

## Shoes

I’m probably pretty good on shoes at this time. That said:

* I wear 11.5, typically  
* I like a wide toebox, which are becoming a bit more common  
* Sperrys or Hey Dudes or that sort of slip on casual shoe are welcomed (my old Toms are looking ratty!)  
* I want Chacos (Classics or Z/Cloud), but they’re so expensive; I’ve looked at used ones, actually

# Disc Golf

I really enjoy disc golf. It’s like a hike while throwing a frisbee.

* Backpack; I have a shoulder sling style disc bag, but I’d like a full backpack that would fit 20 discs and my extendable disc grabber. There are some affordable ones on Amazon, like the Apex one that is green and brown. I don’t need one of the super duper expensive ones, considering I don’t actually play that often. Yet.  
* Disc golf discs with cool prints. Used is fine\! I am not good enough to have strong disc preferences.  
* Any silly, fun, weird accessories

# Camping, Backpacking, & Hiking

This one is really hard, because particularly with backpacking I have very specific preferences. Also, as a family, we’ve struggled to go camping as often as I’d like. 

* Multi-tool with pliers; light ones for backpacking, but any would be good in general; I’d probably carry it in my daily backpack, actually  
* Camp cots; I have one, but I think the whole family would be more comfortable if we had one for each of us  
* Camp kitchen table; this would be the type of thing that holds my Coleman camp stove, plus has a prep area, possibly storage underneath, etc; and folds up for travel  
* Retractable clothes line; I could probably make one, but I’ve been saying that in my head for years  
* Portable camp toilet  
* Pop up shelter for the camp toilet

# Miscellaneous

* The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy on Blu-Ray
