# About Me

![](/images/my-face.png){:.inline} Hey. Prepare for more than you actually cared to know about me when you pressed the link to here. There's not even a reward at the end. The journey is the reward, or something. Anyway, as Samwise Gamgee says, "It’s the job that’s never started that takes the longest to finish." So let's get going.

I enjoy helping people, writing code, and helping people write code. I am the Director of Engineering at [Olio](https://olio.health), where I get to help people, write code, and help people write code that helps people. Olio is made up of people with whom it is great to work (_and_ play, honestly). Ask me about it. I'll happily tell you more!

I've been on a couple podcasts for professional reasons:

+ [Scaling Software Teams](https://software.fireside.fm/miles-sterrett)
+ [Powderkeg](https://powderkeg.com/exciting-trends-in-digital-health/)

Community stuff: I founded [IndyHackers](http://indyhackers.org), a 501(c)3 dedicated to the growth of individuals in the Indiana tech community by fostering community connections and celebrating indivual successes. I organize the [Indianapolis Ruby Brigade](http://indyrb.org) in which we get together once a month to chat about the Ruby programming language, and programming in general. I help a little with [Indy Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/). I have hosted a mechanical keyboard meetup, started a little community around the game KeyForge (which quickly dwindled, but that's okay), a couple communities/events that were but brief flashes in the pan. I like getting people together.

I have many too many hobbies, and hop from one to another like rocks across the stream of time. I dabble with various musical instruments, like guitar, bass, ukulele, mandolin, saxophone, tin whistle, and washboard (not joking!). I like to read a lot ([find me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19490855-miles-sterrett)). I enjoy many different tabletop games—board games, role-playing games, etc. In fact, I on-and-off get obsessed with tabletop roleplaying games. I like backpacking/hiking/camping. These are all things you might see here. The others, probably not so much. Maybe.

Also, I [tweet](http://twitter.com/mileszs). I [push code to Github](http://github.com/mileszs).

Most importantly: I'm lucky enough to have a lovely wife, Melissa, a son, Zane, and a daughter, Aubrey.

I actually _enjoy_ getting email. So please [email me](mailto:miles@mileszs.com).
