# About Me

![](/images/my-face.png){:.inline} Hello! Hmm. Well, I'm pretty good at talking about myself, turns out. So here's a bunch of information, professional and personal.

I enjoy helping people, writing code, and helping people write code. I am the Director of Engineering at [Olio](https://olio.health), where I get to help people, write code, and help people write code that helps people. Olio is made up of people with whom it is great to work (_and_ play, honestly). Ask me about it. I'll happily tell you more!

<br style="clear: both;" />

I've been on a couple podcasts for professional reasons:

+ [Scaling Software Teams](https://software.fireside.fm/miles-sterrett)
+ [Powderkeg](https://powderkeg.com/exciting-trends-in-digital-health/)

Oh, some other stuff. I founded [IndyHackers](http://indyhackers.org), a 501(c)3 dedicated to the education and growth of individuals in the Indiana tech community. I also organize the [Indianapolis Ruby Brigade](http://indyrb.org) in which we get together once a month to chat about the Ruby programming language, and programming in general. Yeah, I like starting communities. I have hosted a mechanical keyboard meetup, started a little community around the game KeyForge (which quickly dwindled, but that's okay), a couple others that were but brief flashes in the pan.

I have many too many hobbies. I dabble with various musical instruments, like guitar, bass, saxophone, and washboard (not joking!). I like to read a lot ([find me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19490855-miles-sterrett)). I already mentioned board games (in the form of KeyForge, but I enjoy many different tabletop games). I also on-and-off get obsessed with tabletop roleplaying games. I like backpacking/hiking/camping. These are all things you might see here. The others, probably not so much. Maybe.

Also, I [tweet](http://twitter.com/mileszs). I [push code to Github](http://github.com/mileszs).

Most importantly: I'm lucky enough to have a lovely wife, Melissa, a son, Zane, and a daughter, Aubrey.

I actually _enjoy_ getting email. So please [email me](mailto:miles@mileszs.com).
