**Update**: I have become more interested in Verge as life and
[Fretless](http://getfretless.com) progresses. In fact, you'll probably see me
there regularly. I do still pine for a hackers-&-founders-ish meeting, and I
think others do as well, so I want to leave this post here. It was always
intended to be constructive (though perhaps I should've chosen a less joke-y
title - Ha).

Today, Anthony Panozzo mentioned [Verge’s]("http://vergeindy.com") new
“qualifying question” policy, in which you essentially must be a startup
employee or founder to attend. I seemingly took that opportunity to pile
on Verge, like some kind of entitled asshole. That wasn’t my intention,
I swear! At least, it wasn’t consciously my intention. Let me clarify.

Quick aside: Matt Hunckler and company have put in good, hard work on
this event. I do not mean to disparage him, others who helped, or those
who attend. I am not saying the event isn’t a worthwhile event.
**SPOILER ALERT**: I’m saying it’s not my thing, basically.

Living in an Alternate Reality
------------------------------

Verge used to be called *Hackers & Founders*. Unfortunately, calling an
event *Hackers & Founders* creates a set of expectations. Let me quote
from [the original Hackers & Founders site]("http://www.hackersandfounders.com/about/"):

> It’s mostly a chance to get together with hackers who are founding or
> are interested in founding startups. Many of us hang out at Hacker
> News. So, if you’re in the area and interested in chatting with people
> of like mind, please stop by. We’d love to get to know you.

… and, from the description of a recent meeting:

> Topics of conversation include hackery in general, startups, shiny new
> technologies we’re playing with, recent articles on Hacker News and
> miscellaneous cool stuff.

That is what I expected when I first attended a meeting. It wasn’t quite
that, but it was fairly casual, and in the back of a bar/restaurant. It
had an intimate feeling to it.

I think I probably should have, both in this instance, and in general, a
more open mind. I think there is a good chance I went in wanting
Mountain View’s *Hackers & Founders*, and I wasn’t willing to settle for
less.

Love What You Got
-----------------

I wanted to like Verge, and attended a couple other events. I had a fine
time. I mean, beer, a festive atmosphere, Earthhouse, excited people…
it’s easy to enjoy. Afterward, however, I always felt like the event
wasn’t really for me. I also felt that I should continue to support the
thing, because it’s good for Indy. (Of course, then I opened my big
mouth / typing fingers on Twitter today.)

It’s hard to explain what about Verge didn’t hit the groove for me.
Again, I think it’s because I was still wanting *Hackers & Founders*. I
wanted, “Man, we’re using Node.js to build this awesome real-time
client-smiting application. Yeah, it’s evented as hell!” … uh, or
something. Instead, it is more high-level, more business-y, more
network-y, more… more…? Seriously, I am not sure I can properly
articulate my problem.

You Don’t Need Me
-----------------

When Anthony and Kyle Shipley began discussing Verge, and the qualifying
question policy, this morning, I jumped up to say I didn’t like this
incarnation of Verge, basically. You can start [with this
tweet]("http://twitter.com/#!/mileszs/status/108186684079882240"), if
you’d like to read more. Also, read [this blog post from
Anthony]("http://22ideastreet.com/blog/verge-discussion/").

Anthony, in that post, says that this makes Verge more interesting for
him. It essentially targets him directly, now. That is a good thing!
Someone feeling like Verge is more relevant is, I’m sure, exactly what
Matt was going for. That it also excludes people fairly directly is also
what Matt was targeting. Matt is always really nice to me, even when he
explicitly invites me to stuff and I don’t attend. I am guessing he
wasn’t expecting that I would feel excluded. Still, it’s a **good
thing**. Creating a group who feels explicitly included is important.
Excluding people is an acceptable consequence, I think. You don’t need
me. You need the Anthonys, Matt Gordons, Kyle Shipleys, etc.

What About Hackers & Founders
-----------------------------

Does this leave space open for a new meeting that is in the spirit of
the original *Hackers & Founders*? I think so. I have a serious question
for those who might be interested, though. Does the *Indy Hackers Bar
Meet* do that sort of thing already? Once a month we get together at a
bar and chat over beers and food. The biggest difference I see is that I
have never made Indy Hackers even almost focused. A few of us talked
about posts on [Reddit]("http://reddit.com") last time — we’re talking
poorly drawn comics and dumb pictures with dumber captions. However, we
also talked about what we’re doing at/for work lately, etc. The Venn
diagram would be a huge circle labeled *Indy Hackers Bar Meet Topics*,
with a little circle inside it labeled *Hackers & Founders Topics*. Is a
combination of the *Indy Hackers Bar Meet* and *Indy.rb*, *Indy.js*, et
cetera, good enough?

I don’t want to change *Indy Hackers Bar Meets*. So, what do you think?
Do we need a *Hackers & Founders* meeting, in the same vein as Mountain
View’s *Hackers & Founders*?
