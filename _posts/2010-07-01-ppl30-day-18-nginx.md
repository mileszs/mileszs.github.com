Many of you have already used Nginx. I apologize if this post is thus quite a bore -- as a friend recently said, "It's just a web server, man." Nonetheless, it's a bit different in that it's event-driven, and built by these guys:

![boris and natasha](/images/boris_natasha.jpg "If we make good web server, we lure moose and squirrell to us for good technology.")

To learn Nginx, I logged into a server I've been using for CI. I'm replacing Apache + Passenger with Nginx + Passenger.

<em><small>This is part of the Peer Pressure Learning 30 series. To learn more about what in the hell that means, see the intro to the series, [A Good Time To Learn](http://mileszs.com/blog/2010/06/13/a-good-time-to-learn.html).</small></em>


## Installation ##

It's a bit more complicated today. 

    sudo gem install passenger
    passenger-install-nginx-module

Barely. That's about it. The Passenger installation takes care of downloading, compiling, and most of the configuring. I just modified the directory for the virtual host, and added some basic authentication, and I had my CI server running!

## Resources ##

### Nginx Wiki ###

Though [the Nginx Wiki](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) lacks all of the documentation that Apache has gathered over the years, it's definitely a good place to start.

### Passenger User Guide ###

Passenger has [a well-written user guide](http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html) to go with its well written installation scripts. I love it. Usually, if I have an issue with Passenger, I just go straight to the user guide. This is remarkable because my process for every other thing that gives me trouble is to go straight to Google.

## What I Think I Now Know ##

Nginx is an event-based server written in C. If "event-based" sounds familiar, Node.js is an event-based Javascript framework for building scalable servers (among other things), and [I did it yesterday](http://mileszs.com/blog/2010/06/30/ppl30-day-17-node-dot-js.html). Event-based is cool with all the hip nerds. Hipster nerds. Hipsnerds. ... And for good reason!

There are [several](http://www.joeandmotorboat.com/2008/02/28/apache-vs-nginx-web-server-performance-deathmatch/) [benchmarks](http://blog.webfaction.com/a-little-holiday-present) that tend to show Nginx significantly out-performaing Apache. The general consensus seems to be that much of this can be attributed to Nginx using an event-driven method, keeping resource use quite low.

Getting it set up was incredibly easy, though that may be due mostly to Passenger's help. Did I get Apache replaced by Nginx successfully? Yup. _\*snap\*_! Done.

So, I thought I'd do a quick benchmark of my own. This is running against an installation of [Signal](http://github.com/dcrec1/signal), an absolutely unoptimized Rails app. It's hosted on a Linode box that hasn't be restarted since they bumped the RAM from ~368 to 512. (Oops.) 

    # Command
    httperf --server scruffy --uri / --num-conns 200

    # Apache + Passenger

    # Nginx + Passenger

Well, I wouldn't call that definitive. I'm not sure I'm even willing to call it _something_. I wish I had pretty graphs for you, but `autobench` is upset with me, and `gnuplot` is pissed at `autobench`, and `httperf` would rather they all just leave him alone. It's been a trying night.

One of the more interesting things about Nginx is the scripting you can do from within a configuration file. If you're brave, check out [this presentation](http://agentzh.org/misc/slides/nginx-conf-scripting/nginx-conf-scripting.html#1) that includes retrieving data from Memcached, or even from MySQL!

I know many of you use Nginx frequently. What do **you** like about it?

It's the weekend (almost? ... Thursday night is close enough)! A busy one! A long one! I must persevere. I'll tell you the schedule ahead of time: Friday => Unicorn, Saturday => MooTools, Sunday => LowPro. Keep the pressure on [Tim Harvey](http://timharvey.net/) and I this weekend. It's going to be a challenge. Who decided this experiment was going to span a holiday?
