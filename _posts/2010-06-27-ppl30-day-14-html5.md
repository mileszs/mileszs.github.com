Today I've been trying to catch up on all features of HTML5 and its brethren: web workers, embedding audio and video without third-party intervention, canvas, application caches, geolocation, persistent local storage, microdata, new form elements, and, last but not least, some new semantic elements. Whew! I started with semantic elements,

## Resources ##

### HTML5 Rocks ###

[HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/) has it all! Interactive presentation, a code playground that allows you to experiment with the API, tutorials, and links to other resources.

### Dive Into HTML 5 ###

Though I like [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/), Mark Pilgrim's [Dive Into HTML 5](http://diveintohtml5.org/) captivated my attention. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for minimal designs, well-layed-out content, and good typography. In any case, it's essentially a book in web form, and I found it an enjoyable read, and a good place to start.

## What I Think I Now Know ##

What do I know? I know that you can start now. That's what I did. If you view the source of this post, you'll notice that several HTML5 elements have snuck in: `header`, `hgroup`, `nav`, `article`, `time`, and `footer`. In addition to new elements, several of the elements you might find in the `head` section of an HTML document and above have been updated to their HTML5 counterparts. Nearly all of it was valid HTML5, thus didn't need changed necessarily, but then what would I write about?

<canvas id="vimd" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("vimd");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.rotate(0.09);
  context.fillStyle = "#dfdfdf";
  context.fillRect(40,0,275,260);
  
  var vimd = new Image();
  vimd.src = "/images/vim_on_a_vine_200.gif";
  vimd.onload = function() {
    context.drawImage(vimd, 50, 10);
  };

  context.shadowOffsetX = 10;
  context.shadowOffsetY = 10;
  context.shadowBlur = 10;
  context.shadowColor = "black";
</script>

I thought I'd play with `<canvas>` a bit. I think it's required, if you're doing anything with HTML5, that you at least mention `<canvas>`. So, I drew what looks like a snapshot of our friend **Vim Diesel**. Precious, isn't he?

Here's the code that got me there:

<% coderay(:lang => :javascript, :line_numbers => :inline) do #_ -%>
<canvas id="vimd" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("vimd");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.rotate(0.09);
  context.fillStyle = "#dfdfdf";
  context.fillRect(40,0,275,260);
  
  var vimd = new Image();
  vimd.src = "/images/vim_on_a_vine_200.gif";
  vimd.onload = function() {
    context.drawImage(vimd, 50, 10);
  };

  context.shadowOffsetX = 10;
  context.shadowOffsetY = 10;
  context.shadowBlur = 10;
  context.shadowColor = "black";
</script>
<% end %>

The geolocation feature is an intrigueing one. I was happy to hear (though I suppose I could've guessed) that it is opt-in. Sure, a site that wants to can probably figure out where I'm at, but at least my client is not going to help them unless I tell it to do so.

The form updates are going to be nice. Automatic validation is going to be interesting. The added elements could be great: sliders, date pickers, color pickers, etc., and a small but welcome one, placeholder text. It sounds silly, but having placeholder text in an input box be native instead of javascript-based makes me happy. You know what doesn't make me happy? Firefox doesn't yet support it. 

There's really so much that goes with HTML5, it's hard to cover it all. I am very happy that I decided to at least attempt to bring my own knowledge up to speed on HTML5. I learned a lot, and it gave me an excuse to take a good look at my blog's markup, too (which could still use some work). I recommend taking a look at [Dive Into HTML 5](http://diveintohtml5.org/). It's a good read!

Tomorrow, I'd like to learn some Python. Perhaps I'll become a Pythonista. I'd like to be some sort of -ista. It sounds glamorous. Well, not so much a barista.
