In the post titled *[Ubuntu 8.04 Alpha VMWare Image](http://soyunperdedor.com/?q=node/10)*, I mentioned that I intended to place a link to torrent up here, when I get the chance. Well, I got the chance, so here it is. This torrent will get you the Ubuntu 8.04 Alpha 2 release.

[Download the Torrent](http://soyunperdedor.comfiles/Ubuntu8.04a2.7z.torrent)  
  
Login: ubuntu  
  
Password: vmplanet.net

The original site, and the location of the http download, if you're interested, is [VMPlanet.net](http://www.vmplanet.net/?q=node/31).

I also recommend [Chrysoar.info](http://chrysaor.info/?page=images). That is where I got my trusty Ubuntu 7.10 image, with VMware tools already installed. They also have OpenBSD and Debian images.

I have only just booted 8.04 Alpha 2, so I have no opinions to put forth as of yet. I'm sure they will explode out of my gaping head-hole any day now. Have a nice day\!
