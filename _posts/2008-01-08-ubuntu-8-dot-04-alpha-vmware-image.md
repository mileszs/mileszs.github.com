Ubuntu is my operating system of choice, these days. I had been using it exclusively as my desktop OS, and had vowed to never install a Microsoft OS again. Then I got a real job, and realized that being idealistic is fun, but not all that practical. My employer's 'system' is based on Microsoft products, so I end up using Windows XP daily. However, I still prefer Ubuntu, and use it daily as well, typically as a virtual machine in VMware Player.

Canonical is currently in the process of developing the next Long-Term Support version of the Ubuntu operating system, 8.04, code-named Hardy Heron. (Learn about the release by visiting [the official site](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/hardy/alpha2).) This version will be actively supported for 3 years, the same as version 6.06. There are not many drastic planned changes for version 8.04, as typically an LTS release will focus more on stabilizing the current system. (By typically, I mean, this is what happened last time.)

### What's Your Freakin' Point?

The point is, I found a VMware appliance for download that will allow you to test the release in a virtual machine. You can test it, but you aren't tied to it. In other words, it could fail, and you won't be too upset, unless you randomly decided to put the only copy of your family photo album on the virtual machine. In that case, you'll be very upset, as well as stupid. From [Ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/hardy/alpha2):

### How do I get it, already?

To download a copy of this virtual machine (for VMware Player), [visit this slightly ad-laden site](http://www.vmplanet.net/?q=node/31). When I get the chance, I'll make a torrent of it and place that here, as well.

If I have any unique comments about the Alpha release, I'll let you know. Let me know what you think, as well.
