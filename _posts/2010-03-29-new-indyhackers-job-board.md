I am excited to announce the birth of the **IndyHackers Job Board**!  Check it
out at [jobs.indyhackers.org](http://jobs.indyhackers.org).

IndyHackers should be more than just a list of events, more than just a
calendar. Sure, the calendar can be helpful, but the site can do more. The site
should do more. Lately, I've heard of several jobs that fit right in the
IndyHackers demographic. I've also heard employers are having a hard time
finding people that fit -- again, the right fit would be people in the
IndyHackers demographic. With a bit of a nudge from [a
friend](http://jqr.github.com/), the **IndyHackers** job board was born.

It is a bit rough around the edges. I am researching job board pricing models,
as well as common job board functionality. I really just wanted to get
something up as soon as possible, considering the jobs of which I keep hearing.
(For instance, [nFrame](http://nframe.com) is hiring a Ruby on Rails
Programmer!  Send your resume to msterrett@nframe.com. /plug) The current job
listing works well for a small set of jobs. Keeping all listings at the top of
the page until one expands a job creates a more-or-less equal footing for each
employer, and makes it easy for prospective employees to browse the list
quickly.  Well, that's what I think, anyway.  What do you think?

If you have a job that you'd like posted to
[IndyHackers](http://indyhackers.org), please email me: miles (at) mileszs
