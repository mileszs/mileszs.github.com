I gave a short presentation discussing the merits of
[DataMapper]("http://datamapper.org/") at the May 2011 [Indy
Ruby Brigade]("http://indyrb.org") meeting. Check it out!

[7.5 Reasons to Use DataMapper]("http://mileszs.com/files/7.5-reasons-datamapper.html")

**UPDATE:** There is now [a video of my presentation]("http://podcast.404dev.com/episodes/033_Miles_Sterrett-Datamapper.m4v") available. Note: I poke fun at a former employer, but it was meant to be good nerdy fun. I hope we can still be friends.
