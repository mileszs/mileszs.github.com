I am a Vim guy. I run [the @vimtips Twitter account]("http://twitter.com/vimtips"). I have given Vim presentations. I maintain [a couple]("https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim") [Vim plugins]("https://github.com/mileszs/apidock.vim") (kinda). I have cultivated [a list of various helpful Vim links]("http://mileszs.github.com/"). My point is that I *really* like Vim. I might even love it. Who am I kidding? I definitely love Vim.

However, I am going to use Emacs every day for the month of February.

I want to challenge myself. I want to learn more about Emacs. I want to
understand why so many of our industry’s elites have, in the short
history of computer programming, loyally and sometimes fanatically used
Emacs. I want to have a little fun.

Thankfully, I know several people using Emacs. I asked for some advice
as to how to hit the ground running on February first ([via
Twitter]("http://twitter.com/#!/mileszs/status/154596352674906112"),
among other means). In case you would like to try Emacs also, I thought
I would document the helpful suggestions I received.

Suggestions for Getting Started
-------------------------------

Five people responded ([@tihm]("http://twitter.com/tihm"),
[@kyleashipley]("http://twitter.com/kyleashipley"),
[@gregors]("http://twitter.com/gregors"),
[@damionjunk]("http://twitter.com/damionjunk"), and
[@mediocretes]("http://twitter.com/mediocretes")). Four of them
recommended the [Emacs Starter
Kit]("https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit"). That sounds
like a ringing endorsement!

Damion also suggested installing Emacs 24 via
[Homebrew]("http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/") (as I’m on a Mac). That
lead me to the article [Emacs 24 Rails Development Environment – From
Scratch to Productive in 5
Minutes]("http://www.viget.com/extend/emacs-24-rails-development-environment-from-scratch-to-productive-in-5-minu/"),
from which I expect I’ll rip some ideas.

Nate (mediocretes) also suggested [his fork of Expected Behavior’s
common-files]("https://github.com/mediocretes/common-files"), and
added “now with twittering-mode” which sounds both wonderful and awful.

Of course, there is [Emacs' Vim
Mode]("http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/VimMode"). I will have to try
that before February has run its course.

That seems like a pretty good start. I hope. I would like to learn a
little [elisp]("http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LearnEmacsLisp"), and
write an extension perhaps, but I doubt I’ll get that far.

Wish me luck. If nothing else, by the end of the month, I will at least
be able to say I’ve been, albeit temporarily, on both sides of the
[Editor War]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war").
