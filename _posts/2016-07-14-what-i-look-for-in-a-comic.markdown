My friend [Dave Jones](https://twitter.com/unixmonkey) introduced me to comics a mere couple years ago. It's not that I didn't know about comics, or had never read a comic, but Dave introduced me to comics that do more to scratch my itches than those I had read previously. He opened my eyes to the plethora of comics that aren't reboots of reboots of super heroes. These are comics I never saw working at a bookstore in high school (we only carried marquee super heroes), or digging through my dad's forgotten, rotting collection. It has led to a fledgling collection of my own, and a blossoming love for the medium. That Dave Jones, man. He's a good dude.

The other day, I was browsing a comic book store with my three-year-old daughter. She grabbed the latest in the series _I Hate Fairyland_, looked up at me, her eyes twinkling, and said, "Daddy, I want to buy this. Can we buy this?" It looked fun, funny. A little girl graced the cover, wearing a pink and yellow dress, with green hair decorated by a big, yellow bow. The giant, bloody battle axe indicated it might be too graphically violent to show my daughter, though. I distracted her with Spidey or something, and we eventually strolled out of the store with only what I went for. (Side question: what comics do I introduce to a non-reader? What comics do I introduce to an early reader?)

I asked Dave recently if he has read any of _I Hate Fairyland_. He said he flipped through it, but it didn't capture him. _Hmm_, I thought. _How does he evaluate comics? How even do I evaluate comics?_ And, to think about later, _How does my daughter evaluate comics!?_

## Traits

It's easy to answer the first question. Here's what Dave said about evaluating comics (on a flip-through in the store, anyway):

> "Art style, anything interesting, ratio of interesting to boring weighed against cost and desire to leave the shop with 4 or less books."

As for me? I have come to conclude there are two primary traits I seek in a comic.

-  **Fantasy genre**: Swords and sorcery. Fairies and magic. Adventurers and monsters. Love that stuff.
-  **Humor**: Certainly, there's a spectrum at play here. However, I perceive that I lean a bit more on humor than the average comic reader.

There are a couple things that I don't particularly care about.

- **Supers**: Ah, man. Supers is the classic genre of comics. Hell, I all but didn't know comic books didn't equate to super hero books until recently. More than just a meh, it's also the quickest turn off for me.
- **Art**: Welp, turns out I don't care too much about 50% of the medium. To be fair, I have a hard time mustering opinions about art in general. I can get used to anything if the story works.

I nearly listed "story/writing" in "traits I seek", but I suspect there aren't many people who care nothing for the story, so it'd be redundant to include it. Perhaps people buy comics for only the art, as I buy for damn near only the story, but I have my doubts.

Back to _I Hate Fairyland_. I suspected I would like it. As soon as my daughter picked it up, I suspected I'd like it. I decided I'd buy the first issue to test my theory (via [ComiXology](https://www.comixology.com/)). So, now I know it's about a girl who, at age 6, gets her wish and is transported to Fairyland. She is told how to get back home, and that it will take maybe a day. Twenty-seven years later, she hasn't found her way home, and she's a bitter, homicidal psycho who appears to not have aged.

I bought the first 5-issue volume in trade paperback form immediately. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Neil Gaiman had a blurb on the front cover. I sat down to read it, and didn't get back up until it was finished. I **love** it.

## Recs

I'm not well-read enough, as far as comics go, to tell you what is great, or best, or even what is definitely good. I can tell you what comics hit my sweet spot, though. The two I've liked the most are _The Rat Queens_, current as of this post, and _Skullkickers_, a finished series. Of the comics I've read, those two are my favorite, and do the best job of combining fantasy (more like _Dungeons and Dragons_ tropes) and humor.

One that doesn't match my usual criteria, but that I still love, is _The Autumnlands_ (formerly _Tooth & Claw_). It is the series that Dave Jones used to lure me into his dark web of comic and comic shop love. It is a much more serious series, but the story and world are great.

I have also read most of the Pathfinder comics (thanks, Humble Bundle), and enjoyed them. If you like D&D-style fantasy tropes, you'll probably enjoy them, too.
