A few sentences I want you to know about a handful of books I read recently:

**_Black Leopard, Red Wolf_ by Marlon James**: I wanted to like this one, as I enjoy the podcast "Marlon and Jake Read Dead People" quite a bit. However, I found it to be a slog. Repetitive imagery meant to shock, I think, and what I think is some purposeful confusion as to timeline and such, perhaps to help ensure the book is treated as literary fiction and not genre fiction.

**_The Rage of Dragons_ by Evan Winter**: I could _not_ put this thing down. I was getting sideways looks from my wife because I was supposed to be helping her, you know, raise kids and maintain a house. Despite its name, dragons are more of an off-camera looming threat than a feature. A caste system plays a much bigger role in engendering rage here. The sequel comes out in November, and I am very excited about it.

**_Akata Witch_ by Nnedi Okorafor**: It was billed to me (via /r/fantasy) as simply "magic school set in Nigeria". Multiple people recommended it. I can be a bit of a sucker for magic school stuff, and, after reading a bit more, it sounded like it was going to be very different from any magic school book I've read previously. It was, and I loved it. As I said, I enjoy magic schools, and I am not ashamed to say I love your typical, European-style take on magic. This is not that. I found the Nigerian influence in this book to be exciting, and refreshing. In fact, I wanted more, as you'll see. (It _is_ YA, in case that matters to you.)

**_Akata Warrior_ by Nnedi Okorafor**: The sequel to _Akata Witch_, it is at least as good, possibly better than the first book. I rolled right into it as soon as I finished _Akata Witch_. More schooling, more magic, more _magical_.

**_Who Fears Death_ by Nnedi Okorafor**: Can you tell I dig Nnedi Okorafor? This book is decidedly _not_ YA. Very much not YA. It is a post-apocalyptic novel set in the Sudan, though technology and the apocalypse feature little. It is about control and suppression of a people, control and suppression of women, and sorcery. It felt like it bore some relationship to the _Akata_ series, and so felt natural to read immediately following those two. (Worth noting: It won the World Fantasy Award in 2011.)
