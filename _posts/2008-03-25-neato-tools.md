I have not posted in more than a month. It has been quite a trying month. I have been married, supervised the birth of my 3 children, build a homeless shelter, and peeled an entire bag of potatoes. Oh ho\! Quite a month\!

You got me; I didn't do any of those things. If I had, what an excuse for not posting, huh? I mean, that would be a seriously hectic month. One would be hard-pressed to even [tweet](http://twitter.com/mileszs) in the midst of all of the hectic halabaloo.

Despite all of the lack of not doing things, I haven't taken the time to even write anything substantial. What I do have are a couple of links or blurbs about new(ish) tools that I find neato and/or useful. I hope you are in agreement. If you have any other suggestions of neato and/or useful things of which you think I should know, than please comment immediately\!

## Wirble

The Ruby Gem [Wirble](http://pablotron.org/software/wirble/) is so awesome yet so easy to overlook. If you haven't used it, you have no idea what you are missing. If you have used it, you probably are unable to work without it. Wirble is a set of enhancements for Irb. If you ask me, colorized results and tab completion are enough to make the gem indispensable, but there are a few other features as well. Here's an example:

## codepad

The site [codepad.org](http://codepad.org/) is a web application along the lines of [Pastie](http://pastie.caboo.se/). It is a simple paste site. At codepad, however, you can also see your code executed (assuming you are pasting one of the supported languages -- yes, Ruby is included). I stole an example from [Why's Poignant Guide](http://poignantguide.net/) to demostrate: <http://codepad.org/3jtYZfRD>.

## shell-fu and dotfiles

You may have already heard of [dotfiles.org](http://dotfiles.org/). It is a site which can be used to upload, download, and share your various configuration files. In particular, things like .bashrc, .vimrc, .screenrc, et cetera. It is certainly worth checking out. Also cool is that world famous Rubyists such as [topfunky](http://nubyonrails.com/) and [\_why](http://whytheluckystiff.net/).

I don't think that [shell-fu](http://www.shell-fu.org/) is all that new, either, but it's a good site. It lists user-submitted command-line tips, tricks, and other assorted treats. It's like bash.org, except most of the items actually have something to do with bash, the shell. (You know, as opposed to creepy social commentary by pale basement-dwellers.) Actually, if you have some tips, please add them. That site is in need of some fresh oil, even if it's not the fancy, expensive, synthetic stuff that they put in Ferraris.

## GitHub

[Git](http://git.or.cz/). You have all heard about it. Even you short, hard-of-hearing folks in the back. You could not have missed it. People have been yelling it into megaphones while standing atop stages (I'm not even positive that's not true). If you waste too much time reading what other Rubysists and Rails-ists write online (like me), you have also heard about [GitHub](http://github.com/). GitHub is a Git repository host, with a bit of a social bend, not to mention the pretty display, the RSS feeds, and more.

I just happen to have a GitHub account. If you'd like to see some of *my* 'dotfiles', you can see them in the [mileszs-linux-configs](http://github.com/MilesZS/mileszs-linux-configs) repository. (You should be aware, some of them were mostly written by my friend [Aaron](http://elasticdog.com/).) Use all or part of them, as you wish.

GitHub is currently in their beta-testing, invite-only phase. If you need an invite, I have two (only two\!) invites left. The first couple interested emails I recieve can have them.

## Conclude Already

Neato, huh? Enjoy\! Also, tell me what you think I missed, as I'm sure I missed some cool tools.
