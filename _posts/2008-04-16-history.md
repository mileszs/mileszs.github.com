Tim Bray didn't tag anyone in [his History post](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/15/History-Meme), but I thought I'd make the quick post anyway. This is a very, **very** geeky Internet Meme.

By the way, Internet access has been intermittent at best for me, outside of work, due to me moving to Indianapolis from Lafayette. That is my excuse, this time, for the lack of posts. On with the show\!

The history will be from the virtual machine on my laptop. This is my work laptop, so fair amounts of RoR work is done. However, it has been my main machine for the past few weeks.

```
mileszs@ubuntuvm:$ history|awk '{a[$2]++} END{for(i in a){printf "%5d\t%s \n",a[i],i}}'|sort -rn|head

  100   clear
   58   vim
   56   svn
   49   ls
   40   twitter
   37   cd
   27   git
   12   sudo
   10   man
    9   ./tweetline
```

I really like having my term windows clear, damn it. It might be some sort of OCD thing. I do find myself clearing compulsively, having only typed 'ls' and hit enter out of lack of focus in the first place. Oh, how pathetic.

The 'twitter' command is the [Twitter RubyGem](http://twitter.rubyforge.org/), with which I have been playing. The './tweetline' is a script I was writing -- more on that in the coming days.

I'm going to tag [Aaron](http://elasticdog.com/) and [Seth](http://linux.dudenhofer.net/wordpress/). GO\!
